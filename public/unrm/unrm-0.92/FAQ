unrm version 0.9 FAQ

1. What is unrm?

unrm is a small but powerfull shell utility which can help you recover
erased data.His origins can be found in the Linux Ext2fs Undeletion
Mini-HOWTO (which should be right in your /usr/doc/Linux-mini-HOWTOs/
directory),written by Aaron Crane, <aaronc@pobox.com>

2. What is not unrm?

Recycle Bin

3. A malicious,evil hacker has erased all the log files in the system.Can
I bring them back?

If the inodes where the logs used to be,are still free (not overwritten by
any other files) - yes,you can recover them!

Examples:

./unrm /dev/hda1 - searches for all the erased files on /dev/hda1
./unrm /dev/hda3 -u guest - searches /dev/hda3 for files previously owned by
'guest'
./unrm /dev/hdc1 -u any -s not so long string in here - searches /dev/hdc1
for all the erased data,containing the "not so long string in here" string.

4. Is it 100% sure that unrm will recover all of my files?

No,but if you respect some basic rules,the chances can get very high:

- stop immediately all the processes that write data on your hard-disk
(syslogd,sendmail etc) 
- if the partition where the erased data used to be isn't mounted on
/,umount it and remount it read-only. (and try not to launch unrm from it)
- think positively about unrm!

5. Ok,so where are the erased files?

unrm.recovered/unrm.inode#
Look through those strange files (dumped inodes) with a (regular) file viewer 
and (maybe) you'll be able to find your erased data.
 
6. Who can run unrm?

Since unrm needs full access to the filesystem,it can be run only by root.
